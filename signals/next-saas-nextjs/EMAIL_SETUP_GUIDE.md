### Option 2: Gmail with App Password (Alternative)

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication**
   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
   - Enable "2-Step Verification"

2. **Create App Password**
   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Select "Mail" and "Other (Custom name)"
   - Name it "Signals App"
   - Copy the 16-character password

3. **Update .env file**
   ```env
   # Comment out Resend and use Gmail instead
   # RESEND_API_KEY="re_YOUR_API_KEY"

   EMAIL_SERVER_HOST="smtp.gmail.com"
   EMAIL_SERVER_PORT="587"
   EMAIL_SERVER_USER="your-gmail@gmail.com"
   EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD="xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx"  # App password
   EMAIL_FROM="Signals <your-gmail@gmail.com>"
   ```

4. **Update email.ts to use nodemailer**
   (Gmail setup requires switching back to nodemailer)

## How It Works

1. **User enters email** on any drill page
2. **Magic link is sent** to their email
3. **User clicks link** to verify
4. **Email is marked as verified** in database
5. **User gets full access** to all features

## Testing Flow

1. Navigate to any drill: http://localhost:5001/signal/6
2. Enter name and email in the modal
3. Check email inbox for verification link
4. Click the link to verify
5. You're verified! âœ…

## Features Included

- âœ… Magic link authentication
- âœ… 6-digit code fallback
- âœ… Session management with Redis
- âœ… Database tracking (PostgreSQL)

## Troubleshooting

### Emails not sending?
- Check API key is correct in .env
- Make sure you restarted the server after updating .env
- Check server console for error messages

### "Email not configured" message?
- This appears when RESEND_API_KEY is not set
- The magic link will be logged to console instead
- Perfect for testing without email setup!
