Bitcoin has broken through the $95,000 resistance level, marking a significant milestone in the cryptocurrency's ongoing bull run. The surge comes amid increased institutional adoption and growing confidence in digital assets.

## Key Drivers Behind the Rally

Several factors have contributed to Bitcoin's impressive price action:

1. **Institutional Inflows**: Major financial institutions continue to accumulate Bitcoin, with spot ETF inflows reaching record highs this week.

2. **Favorable Regulatory Environment**: Recent clarity from global regulators has boosted investor confidence in the long-term viability of cryptocurrencies.

3. **Supply Dynamics**: The limited supply of Bitcoin, combined with increasing demand, continues to drive price appreciation.

## Technical Analysis

From a technical perspective, Bitcoin has successfully broken above key resistance levels:

- **Support**: $90,000 (strong support)
- **Resistance**: $100,000 (psychological level)
- **RSI**: Currently at 68, indicating strong momentum without being overbought

## What This Means for Pakistani Traders

For traders in Pakistan, this presents both opportunities and risks:

- **Opportunity**: Strong uptrend with potential for further gains
- **Risk**: Increased volatility and potential for sharp corrections
- **Strategy**: Consider taking partial profits at key resistance levels while maintaining core positions

## Expert Opinion

"This rally appears to be fundamentally driven, not just speculative," says our lead analyst. "However, traders should always use proper risk management, especially with stop-loss orders."

## Trading Recommendations

- **Entry**: Wait for pullbacks to $92,000-$93,000 range
- **Stop Loss**: Below $90,000
- **Target**: $100,000 initial target, $110,000 extended target
- **Risk/Reward**: Favorable at current levels
