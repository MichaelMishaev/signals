                    <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH RISK WARNING:</strong> Trading foreign exchange (Forex), cryptocurrencies,
                    commodities, options, futures, and stocks involves <strong>substantial risk of loss</strong> and
                    may not be suitable for all investors. You could lose some or all of your invested capital.
                    Leverage can magnify both profits and losses. Before trading, carefully consider your financial
                    situation, investment experience, risk tolerance, and objectives. <strong>Only trade with money you
                    can afford to lose completely.</strong> Never use borrowed funds or money needed for essential
                    expenses.

                  <p>
                    <strong>üìä MAJORITY OF TRADERS LOSE MONEY:</strong> Statistical data shows that the majority of
                    retail traders lose money when trading leveraged products. You should consider whether you fully
                    understand how these products work and whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your
                    money. Past success rates do not predict your individual performance.
