## 🏗️ System Architecture Summary

### Hybrid Approach

**Two Content Types:**

#### 1. Static UI (JSON-based)
```
What: Buttons, labels, navigation, footer
Storage: /public/locales/en/*.json, /public/locales/ur/*.json
Count: ~120 strings
Workflow: Translate once → Done forever
Performance: 10-50ms (instant)
```

#### 2. Dynamic Content (Database-based)
```
What: Signal titles, descriptions, news, analysis
Storage: Supabase `translations` table
Count: Ongoing (new content daily)
Workflow: Content manager translates → Admin approves → Live
Performance: 200-500ms first load, 50ms cached
```

## 🔄 Translation Workflow

### Static UI (One-Time Setup)
```
Week 1:
Day 1-2: Developer extracts UI strings
Day 3-5: Content manager translates 120 strings
Day 6: Admin reviews & approves
Day 7: Deploy → Done forever ✅

Result: 80% of translation value delivered
```

### Dynamic Content (Ongoing)
```
Daily:
1. New signal created (English)
   → System auto-creates translation entry

2. Content manager logs in
   → Sees new untranslated content
   → Translates to Urdu
   → Submits for approval

3. Admin gets notification
   → Reviews translation
   → Approves → Goes live immediately

Timeline: Hours to days (acceptable)
```

## 🌐 RTL (Right-to-Left) Support

### What Changes for Urdu:
```
✓ Text direction: Right to left
✓ Layout: Mirrored (menu flips, images swap sides)
✓ Icons: Reversed arrows (→ becomes ←)
✓ Alignment: Text aligns right
```

### How It Works:
```html
<!-- English -->
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">

<!-- Urdu -->
<html lang="ur" dir="rtl">
```

Entire layout automatically flips using CSS logical properties.
