# How the Gate System Works - Simple Explanation

## 🎯 The Basic Idea

Think of it like a video game with levels:

```
Level 1-3:  FREE (anyone can play)
Level 4:    🚪 GATE #1 - Need email to continue
Level 5-9:  FREE (for email users)
Level 10+:  🚪 GATE #2 - Need broker account to continue
```

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Does viewing the same signal twice count as 2 drills?**
A: No! Each unique signal ID counts once. Viewing signal #1 three times = 1 drill.

**Q: What happens if I clear cookies?**
A: You go back to Anonymous user. Have to provide email again.

**Q: Can I skip the email gate?**
A: No. It's a HARD GATE. Must provide email to continue.

**Q: What if I close the browser after providing email?**
A: Your email status is saved in localStorage. When you return, you're still an "Email User".

**Q: When does the broker verification happen?**
A: Later! Right now, clicking "Open Broker Account" just tracks the click. Real verification via broker postback will be added later.
