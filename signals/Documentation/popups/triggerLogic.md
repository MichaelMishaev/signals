# Signal Access & Gate Logic - Complete Guide

## Overview

We use a **two-gate system** to convert visitors into engaged users and then into broker account holders:

1. **Email Gate** - Captures user email after 3 free signal views
2. **Broker Gate** - Requires broker account after 9 total signal views (6 after email)

All gates are configured in `/src/config/gates.ts`

**Architecture:**
- Core logic: `/src/mechanisms/gateFlowMechanism.ts` (pure functions)
- Configuration: `/src/config/gates.ts`
- State management: `/src/utils/gateState.ts`
- React integration: `/src/hooks/useGateFlow.ts`
- UI components: `/src/components/shared/gates/`

## üîÑ Gate Triggering Logic

### Email Gate Logic:

```javascript
// Check if email gate should appear
function shouldShowEmailGate(user) {
  const drillsViewed = user.drillHistory.length;

  return (
    !user.hasEmail &&           // User hasn't provided email
    drillsViewed >= 3           // User has viewed 3 drills
  );
}

// Trigger on 4th drill attempt
if (shouldShowEmailGate(user) && attemptingDrill === 4) {
  showEmailGate();
}
```

### Broker Gate Logic:

```javascript
// Check if broker gate should appear
function shouldShowBrokerGate(user) {
  const drillsAfterEmail = user.drillHistory.filter(
    drill => drill.timestamp > user.emailProvidedAt
  ).length;

  return (
    user.hasEmail &&                    // User has provided email
    !user.hasBrokerAccount &&           // User hasn't opened broker
    drillsAfterEmail >= 6               // User viewed 6 drills after email
  );
}

// Trigger on 10th drill attempt (6th after email)
if (shouldShowBrokerGate(user) && drillsAfterEmail === 6) {
  showBrokerGate();
}
```

## üìà Signal Counting Rules

### What Counts as a "Signal View"?

‚úÖ **COUNTS:**
- Clicking a signal from homepage ‚Üí viewing drill-down page
- Viewing full signal details (entry, stop, take profit)
- Viewing signal analysis, charts, technical levels

‚ùå **DOES NOT COUNT:**
- Browsing signal list on homepage
- Hovering over signal cards
- Refreshing the same signal page
- Clicking "Back" button

### Counting Examples:

**Scenario 1: Fresh Visitor**
```
Homepage ‚Üí Signal #1 (count: 1)
Homepage ‚Üí Signal #2 (count: 2)
Homepage ‚Üí Signal #3 (count: 3)
Homepage ‚Üí Signal #4 (EMAIL GATE)
```

**Scenario 2: After Email Provided**
```
Counter RESETS when email provided
Signal #5 (count: 1 after email)
Signal #6 (count: 2 after email)
Signal #7 (count: 3 after email)
Signal #8 (count: 4 after email)
Signal #9 (count: 5 after email)
Signal #10 (count: 6 after email) ‚Üí BROKER GATE
```

**Scenario 3: Refresh/Revisit**
```
User views Signal #1, then refreshes page
‚Üí Still count: 1 (no double-counting)

User views Signal #1, leaves site, returns tomorrow
‚Üí Count persists in localStorage
‚Üí Still count: 1
```

## üîß Broker Promotion Banner (Optional)

**Note:** This is SEPARATE from the Broker Gate and appears BEFORE the gate.

**When does it show?**
Shows a non-blocking promotional banner when:
- ‚úÖ User has email
- ‚úÖ User does NOT have broker
- ‚úÖ User meets ANY trigger:
  - Viewed 6+ signals after email
  - OR viewing signal with confidence >85%
  - OR viewing profitable signal
- ‚úÖ Last shown 3+ minutes ago

**What does it do?**
- Displays dismissible banner at top of signal page
- Promotes broker deposit bonuses
- User can dismiss and continue viewing signals
- Does NOT block access (unlike Broker Gate)

**How is it different from Broker Gate?**

| Feature | Broker Promotion Banner | Broker Gate |
|---------|------------------------|-------------|
| Type | Soft promotion | Hard gate |
| Blocking | No (dismissible) | Yes (must act) |
| Trigger | 6+ drills after email | 10th drill attempt |
| Frequency | Every 3 minutes | Once only |
| User can dismiss | Yes | No |
